</Step>
</Steps>

## Step 2: Check what's available

<Steps>
<Step title="Check stock">
  Let's see what accounts are available right now:
  
  ```bash
  curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" \
       https://api.nicealts.com/v1/stock
  ```
  
  You should see something like:
  
  ```json
  {
    "Unban (AccessToken)": {
      "price": 50,
      "stock": 150
    },
    "Ban (AccessToken)": {
      "price": 30,
      "stock": 75
    },
    "Unban HQ (Cookie)": {
      "price": 100,
      "stock": 25
    }
  }
  ```
</Step>
</Steps>

## Step 3: Make your first purchase

<Steps>
<Step title="Choose your account type">
  Pick what you want to buy:
  - **Unban (AccessToken)** - Unbanned accounts, great for most uses
  - **Ban (AccessToken)** - Banned accounts, cheaper option
  - **Unban HQ (Cookie)** - High-quality cookie accounts, premium option
</Step>

<Step title="Place your order">
  Let's buy 1 Unban AccessToken account with full prechecking:
  
  ```bash
  curl -X POST \
       -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -d '{
         "product": "Unban (AccessToken)",
         "quantity": 1,
         "precheck": "full"
       }' \
       https://api.nicealts.com/v1/order
  ```
</Step>

<Step title="Get your accounts">
  If everything went well, you'll receive your account details as plain text. The accounts will be delivered immediately!
  
  <Check>
  Success! You've just made your first API purchase. The account details should be in the response.

**Pro tip:** Start with small quantities and test your integration before scaling up. The API is fast, but it's always good to test first!
