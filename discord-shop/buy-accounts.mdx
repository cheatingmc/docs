## Basic purchase process

### Step 1: Check your balance

First, verify you have enough credits:

```
/balance
```

This shows your current credit balance and recent transactions.

### Step 2: Check available stock

See what accounts are available:

```
/stock
```

This displays all available account types, prices, and stock levels.

### Step 3: Make your purchase

Use the purchase command:

```
/buy [account-type] [quantity]
```

## Purchase commands

### Basic syntax

```
/buy [type] [quantity] [options]
```

### Account type options

- `unban` - Unban (AccessToken) accounts
- `ban` - Ban (AccessToken) accounts  
- `cookie` - Unban HQ (Cookie) accounts

### Quantity limits

- **Minimum:** 1 account

### Purchase examples

```

/buy cookie 2         # Buy 2 premium Cookie accounts
/buy unban 5          # Buy 5 unbanned AccessToken accounts
```

## Advanced purchase options

### Prechecking options

Add prechecking to ensure account quality:

```
/buy unban 1 precheck:full    # Full validation (recommended)
/buy unban 1 precheck:none    # No prechecking (faster)
```

<Info>
**Prechecking:** Validates accounts before delivery to ensure they work properly. Adds a small delay but guarantees quality.
</Info>

```
/buy unban 2 precheck:full    # 2 unbanned accounts with full validation
/buy ban 1 precheck:none      # 1 banned account without prechecking
