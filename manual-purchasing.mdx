## Purchasing accounts

### Basic purchase command

To buy accounts, use the `/buy` command:

```

### Examples

```
/buy unban 1          # Buy 1 unbanned AccessToken account
/buy ban 3            # Buy 3 banned AccessToken accounts
/buy cookie 2         # Buy 2 premium Cookie accounts
```

### Purchase options

Some account types support additional options:

```
/buy unban 1 precheck:full    # Buy with full prechecking
/buy unban 1 precheck:none    # Buy without prechecking (faster)
```

<Info>
**Prechecking:** Optional validation that ensures accounts are working before delivery. Adds a small delay but guarantees quality. Available for all account types.
</Info>

## Understanding your purchase

### What you'll receive

After a successful purchase, you'll receive:

1. **Account details** - Email, password, and access token/cookie data
2. **Delivery format** - Each account on a separate line
3. **Order confirmation** - Purchase details and timestamp

### Example delivery format

```

### Using your accounts

- **AccessToken accounts**: Use the email, password, and access token for authentication

<Warning>
Keep your account details secure! Never share them publicly or store them in unsecured locations.
