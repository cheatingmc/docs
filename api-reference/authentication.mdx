## Getting your API key

Your API key is your gateway to the NiceAlts API. It's tied directly to your Discord account balance, so you can only spend what you have available.

<Steps>
<Step title="Join our Discord server">
  First, you'll need to join our Discord community to access the bot.

</Step>

<Step title="Use the slash command">
  Once you're in the server, use the `/api-key` slash command to generate your unique API key.
  
  ```
  /api-key
  ```
  
  The bot will generate a new API key for you and display it in a private message.
</Step>

<Step title="Save your API key">
  Copy the generated API key and store it securely. You'll need it for all API requests.
  
  <Warning>
  Your API key is sensitive! Anyone with access to it can make purchases using your Discord balance. Store it securely and never share it publicly.
  </Warning>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Using your API key

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header of every request:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
```

### Example

Here's how to include your API key in a request:

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer x5BOtn5K2P7ZT344Df0i2sC532xWdmuZ2QPLdK9TtvUoMXU1" \
     https://api.nicealts.com/v1/stock
```

```python Python
import requests

headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer x5BOtn5K2P7ZT344Df0i2sC532xWdmuZ2QPLdK9TtvUoMXU1"
}

response = requests.get("https://api.nicealts.com/v1/stock", headers=headers)
```

```javascript JavaScript
const headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer x5BOtn5K2P7ZT344Df0i2sC532xWdmuZ2QPLdK9TtvUoMXU1"
};

fetch("https://api.nicealts.com/v1/stock", { headers })
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => console.log(data));
```
</CodeGroup>

## API key format

Your API key will look something like this:

```
x5BOtn5K2P7ZT344Df0i2sC532xWdmuZ2QPLdK9TtvUoMXU1
```

- **Length:** 40 characters
- **Format:** Alphanumeric string
- **Case:** Case-sensitive

## Security best practices

<Warning>
**Important security considerations:**
</Warning>

- **Never commit API keys to version control** - Use environment variables instead
- **Don't share API keys publicly** - Anyone with your key can spend your credits
- **Rotate keys regularly** - Generate new keys periodically for better security
- **Use HTTPS only** - Always make requests over secure connections

### Environment variables

Store your API key as an environment variable:

<CodeGroup>
```bash .env
NICEALTS_API_KEY=x5BOtn5K2P7ZT344Df0i2sC532xWdmuZ2QPLdK9TtvUoMXU1
```

```python Python
import os

api_key = os.getenv("NICEALTS_API_KEY")
headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}"}
```

```javascript JavaScript
const apiKey = process.env.NICEALTS_API_KEY;
const headers = {"Authorization": `Bearer ${apiKey}`};
```
</CodeGroup>

## Troubleshooting authentication

### Invalid API key error

If you receive a `401 Unauthorized` error:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Check your API key format">
  Make sure you're using the correct format:
  
  ```
  Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
  ```
  
  Note the space between "Bearer" and your key.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Verify your API key">
  Double-check that you copied the API key correctly from Discord. API keys are case-sensitive.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Generate a new key">
  If you're still having issues, try generating a new API key using `/api-key` in Discord.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Insufficient balance error

If you receive a `402 Payment Required` error:

<Info>
This means you don't have enough credits in your Discord account balance to complete the purchase.
</Info>

1. Check your balance using the Discord bot
2. Purchase more credits if needed
3. Retry your API request
