## Account types

We offer three types of Minecraft accounts:

### Unban (AccessToken)
- **Price:** 50 credits
- **Quality:** High
- **Best for:** Most use cases, reliable and fast
- **Prechecking:** Available

### Ban (AccessToken)
- **Price:** 30 credits
- **Quality:** Standard
- **Best for:** Budget-conscious users
- **Prechecking:** Available

### Unban HQ (Cookie)
- **Price:** 100 credits
- **Quality:** Premium
- **Best for:** High-value applications
- **Prechecking:** Available

## Prechecking options

When placing orders, you can choose from two prechecking levels:

- **`none`** - No prechecking (faster delivery, lower cost)
- **`full`** - Full validation (checks account validity and ban status)

<Tip>
Use full prechecking for important applications where account quality is critical. Use none for bulk purchases where speed matters more.
</Tip>

## Rate limits

To ensure fair usage, we implement the following rate limits:

- **100 requests per minute** per API key
- **10 orders per minute** per API key

Rate limit information is included in response headers:

- `X-RateLimit-Limit` - Your rate limit
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining` - Requests remaining in current window
- `X-RateLimit-Reset` - When the rate limit resets

## Error handling

The API uses standard HTTP status codes and returns detailed error messages in JSON format. See our [error handling guide](/api-reference/error-handling) for complete details.
